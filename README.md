# Chatbot-with-Personalized-Memory-RAG-Vector-Databases-
**1. Project Overview**

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot with personalized memory, utilizing vector databases for efficient information retrieval. The chatbot remembers past interactions, adapts responses based on user history, and provides intelligent answers using LLMs (Large Language Models) and embeddings.

**2. Requirements Gathering**

   
**🛠 Functional Requirements:**

✅ Users can interact with the chatbot for question-answering.

✅ The chatbot remembers past conversations and personalizes responses.

✅ It retrieves relevant information from vector databases for context-aware answers.

✅ Users can store custom notes in the memory (like a personal assistant).

✅ The chatbot integrates with LLMs like OpenAI GPT, Llama, or Hugging Face models.

✅ It supports real-time response generation using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).


**⚙ Non-Functional Requirements:**

⚡ Fast and efficient query retrieval.

🔐 Secure storage of user data and embeddings.

📊 Scalable architecture to handle multiple users.

🌐 API support for web or mobile integration.


**📜 3. How Does RAG Work?**

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval-based models and generative models:


User Query → The user inputs a message.

Vector Embedding → The query is converted into an embedding vector.

Vector Search → The system searches a vector database (like FAISS, Pinecone, or ChromaDB) to find relevant context.

Response Generation → The retrieved information is passed to an LLM (GPT, Llama, etc.) for response generation.

Response → The chatbot provides a context-aware response with personalized memory.

**4. Implementation (Python Code)**
   
**🔹 Step 1: Install Dependencies**

Make sure to install required libraries:

"pip install openai langchain chromadb faiss-cpu sentence-transformers"

**🔹 Step 2: Initialize Vector Database (ChromaDB or FAISS)**

**🔹 Step 3: Create a Function to Store Chat History**
**
🔹 Step 4: Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

🔹 Step 5: Build the Chat Interface

🔹 Step 6: Export and Visualize Memory Data**

**Running the Chatbot**

After implementing the above steps, run:

"python chatbot.py"

💬 The chatbot will remember past conversations and provide contextual responses.
